\description{
\pkg{ENMeval} provides several ways to partition occurrence and background localities into bins for training and validation (or, evaluation and calibration). 
Users should carefully consider the objectives of their study and the influence of spatial bias when deciding on a method of data partitioning.

These functions are used internally to partition data during a call of \code{\link{ENMevaluate}} but can also be used independently to generate data partitions. 
For user-specified partitions, users can simply define groups of occurrence records and background points directly with \code{ENMevaluate}.

The \code{get.block} method partitions occurrence localities by finding the latitude and/or longitude lines that divide the occurrence localities into four groups of (insofar as possible) equal numbers.
The order and nature of the divisions can be controlled with the "orientation" parameter.
The default is "lat_lon", which divides first by a latitudinal line, then second by longitudinal lines.
This method is based on the spatial partitioning technique described in Radosavljevic & Anderson (2014), where the "lon_lon" option was used.
Background localities are assigned to each of the four groups based on their position with respect to these lines. 
While the \code{get.block} method results in (approximately) equal division of occurrence localities among four groups, the number of background localities (and, consequently, environmental and geographic space) in each group depends on the distribution of occurrence localities across the study area.

The \code{get.checkerboard} methods are variants of a checkerboard approach to partition occurrence localities. 
These methods use the \code{spatSample} function of the \pkg{terra} package (Hijmans 2023) to partition records according to checkerboard squares generated based on the input rasters. 
The spatial grain of these squares is determined by resampling (or aggregating) the original environmental input grids based on the user-defined \code{aggregation factor} (e.g., an aggregation factor with value 2 results in a checkerboard with grid cells four times the area of the original input rasters). 
With one input aggregation factor, \code{get.checkerboard} partitions data into two groups according to a 'basic' checkerboard pattern. With two aggregation factors, \code{get.checkerboard} partitions data into four groups according to 'hierarchical', or nested, checkerboard squares (see Muscarella et al. 2014). 
In contrast to the \code{get.block} method, the \code{get.checkerboard} methods subdivide geographic space equally but do not ensure a balanced number of occurrence localities in each group. 
The \code{get.checkerboard} methods give warnings (and potentially errors) if zero points (occurrence or background) fall in any of the expected bins.

The \code{get.jackknife} method is a special case of \emph{k}-fold cross validation where the number of bins (\emph{k}) is equal to the number of occurrence localities (\emph{n}) in the dataset. 
It is suggested for occurrence datasets of relatively small sample size (generally < 25 localities) (Pearson \emph{et al.} 2007; Shcheglovitova and Anderson 2013).

The \code{get.randomkfold} method partitions occurrence localities randomly into a user-specified number of (\emph{k}) bins. 
This is equivalent to the method of \emph{k}-fold cross validation currently provided by Maxent. 

Users can also define custom partitions for occurrence and background data in the call to `ENMevaluate` with the "user.grp" parameter.
}
\note{
The \code{checkerboard} methods are designed to partition occurrence localities into spatial evaluation bins: two ('basic', for one aggregation factor) or four ('hierarchical', for two aggregation factors). 
They may give fewer bins, however, depending on where the occurrence localities fall with respect to the grid cells (e.g., all records happen to fall in one group of checkerboard squares). 
A warning is given if the number of bins is < 4 for the hierarchical method, and an error is given if all localities fall into a single evaluation bin.
